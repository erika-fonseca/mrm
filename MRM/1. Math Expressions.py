# MAGIC # Display mathematical equations
# MAGIC Notebooks support [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/wiki) for displaying mathematical formulas and equations. For example,
# MAGIC
# MAGIC \\( f(\beta)= -Y_t^T X_t \beta + \sum log( 1+{e}^{X_t\bullet\beta}) + \frac{1}{2}\delta^t S_t^{-1}\delta\\)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC where \\(\delta=(\beta - \mu_{t-1})\\)
